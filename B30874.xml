            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the Priſoner ſtands Indicted of high Treaſon for receiving <hi>Joſeph Kelloway</hi> and <hi>Henry Lawrence,</hi> who were Traitors, and known to him to be Traitors, and harbouring them in his Houſe, and giving them Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Comfort: this, Gentlemen, is clearly High-Treaſon by Law; and tho' this man himſelf were not in actual Rebellion, yet, if he do receive any that he knows to have been ſo, he is equally guilty; he is a principal Traitor by the Judgment of the Law; and however he would now pretend his Ignorance, that he did not know that they were in the Army, or, if he did know they were in the Army, that he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd ſo great a danger as the forfeiture of his Life, which now he ſtands as well as he can to defend; yet it does appear plainly to you, not only by his own Confeſſion taken upon his Examination, but likewiſe by the Teſtimony of the Witneſſes, who were preſent at the time when he did confeſs that theſe men had diſcourſed with him, and acknowledged that they were in <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Army, and that he was routed, and that yet he did entertain and receive them: The firſt Witneſs indeed does not ſay the very thing, but it is very much inducing to the Evidence that is given more expreſs by the other Witneſs, for he ſays, that he was at his Houſe, and he enquired for them there, tho he did not ſee him at all, but his People; and they not only did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that they had lodged there, but that there was a Lodging provided for them elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: but however, if that were quite laid aſide, and not taken at all into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet what is teſtified by the other Witneſſes, and upon his own Examination, makes it as clear and plain as can be, that he did receive theſe Perſons into his houſe, and comfort them, and entertain them, knowing them to have been guilty of High-Treaſon, that is, to have been in the Army of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> of that Party, and that they came to <hi>London,</hi> and went away from the <hi>Weſt</hi> becauſe he was beaten; and there is an Expreſſion in the Examination to that purpoſe: ſo that I take the Indictment to be very fully and clearly proved upon him; and it is not his Ignorance of the Law that will excuſe him, that is, his ignorance of the Danger that he hath incurr'd by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining theſe People; altho you cannot but take notice, that he was in ſome dread had fear that it was an offence to do ſo; for at fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And the courſe of our Evidence will be this: We will prove that this <hi>James Burton</hi> ſtood our lawed for Treaſon before he committed a new Treaſon, when he went into the <hi>West,</hi> and was there with <hi>Monmouth</hi> in the late Rebellion; and tho, Gentlemen, the very Outlawry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſaid <hi>Burton</hi> is enough to ſatisfie any man, that this man could not be ignor and that he was a Traitor, for no man can imagine, when a man ſtands out a Proceſs till he become out-lawed for High-Treaſon, that any ſhould be ignorant that he is guilty of Treaſon, and that it would be very dangerous to receive a man after that, without any more evidence: But this <hi>Burton,</hi> after he was out-lawed and fled, came again, and was in Arms with <hi>Monmouth</hi> in the Rebellion; and after their Defeat he came up to Town: and <hi>Fernley</hi> knowing he had been then in the <hi>Weſt</hi> vvith <hi>Monmouth,</hi> he received him, and harboured him; and this vve vvill prove by Witneſſes.

               <p>This, my Lord, may give ſome account that I had no deſign againſt the Government. I am a poor man, my Lord, and upon that account I owe a great deal of money: I knew there was 100 <hi>l.</hi> for ſecuring <hi>Burton,</hi> there was no gain by concealing him; he was not a perſon could require me, that I ſhould harbour him, and loſe 100 <hi>l.</hi> which was certain for taking him; which (my Lord) ſhews I had no deſign.</p>

               <p>No, this argues you to be a ſtronger Confederate; and that you were ſo firm to your Party, you would not gain 100 <hi>l.</hi> though you might have it for doing your duty.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, this Priſoner ſtands indicted for harbouring and relieving one <hi>James Burton,</hi> knowing him to have committed Treaſon. Gentlemen, you are to be acquainted, that this <hi>James Burton,</hi> was not only guilty of the late Rebellion in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> but he was likewiſe charged by proceſs with being guilty of the Plot at the <hi>Rye-houſe,</hi> and thereupon there was ſuch proceedings by Law, that he was Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed, the Record of which Outlawry hath been produced to you; ſo that if there were no more, if you be perſwaded that he is the Perſon guilty, whether he were in the Rebellion in the <hi>Weſt</hi> or no, that may induce you to find this Indictment, for the Priſoner receiving him after the Rebellion in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and knowing him to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Treaſon, whereupon he was Outlawed, it equally makes him liable to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence wherewith he is charged: But, Gentlemen, that is not all; you have expreſs Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony from <hi>Burton</hi> himſelf, who it ſeems was acquainted with him, and who had fled from his Neighbourhood, by the ſpace of two years almoſt, and yet he receives this <hi>Burton</hi> into his houſe: I will not ſay at the firſt time that he came into his houſe, it doth appear by any Evidence, that he knew him to have been in the Rebellion in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> but when he came thither upon <hi>Friday,</hi> he was ſo kind to him as to leave his own Chamber, and to let him have that for his Lodging, although now he gives you another excuſe plainly frivolous and falſe, that is, a pretence of making way for his Wife to lie-in, who yet is not delivered. He lies there upon <hi>Saturday</hi>-night, and dines with him upon <hi>Sunday. Saturday</hi> perhaps might be a buſie day, and there is no Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony at all given by any Evidence of any Diſcourſe that was between them upon that day, but upon <hi>Sunday,</hi> when they Dined together, <hi>Burton</hi> ſwears, that he did tell him that he had been in the <hi>Weſt</hi> in the Rebellion there, and he came thither for ſhelter: This man being acquainted with this, allowed him to dine with him, and harboured him in his Houſe for the ſpace of Seven or Eight hours more, without bringing him before any Juſtice of Peace, or any Magiſtrate who had Authority to commit him, although he had a particular Authority of his own (as he was a Conſtable) for the conſervation of the Peace, yet he forgets his Oath as well as his Duty and Allegiance, and ſuffers him ſtill to remain there. It is true the Wife of <hi>Burton</hi> dined with them, as <hi>Burton</hi> himſelf ſays, and the Woman confeſſes, but ſhe was ſo buſie at her Victuals, that ſhe can remember nothing, ſhe did not hear that there was any Diſcourſe concerning <hi>Monmouth.</hi> But leſt you ſhould want another Witneſs, for <hi>Burton</hi> is but one Witneſs to that particular, you have him plainly confeſſing it himſelf, which is above a Thouſand Witneſſes, you have him confeſſing that <hi>Burton</hi> did acknowledg he had been in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and that <hi>Monmouth</hi> was Routed, and yet he continues him in his houſe, nay more, this man doth appear to be a Perſon in whom there was that gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at Confidence, that another Perſon, <hi>Gaunt</hi> came, and he bids him come into his houſe, and there he diſcourſt of ſome Traytors, and the means of conveying them away, that they ſhould not ſuffer for their Treaſon, and diſcourſed likewiſe of conveying away <hi>Burton,</hi> though he had confeſſed it himſelf. Gentlemen, what he tells you, is, that he did mean to diſcover, when did he intend to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover? he did not diſcover to any Body, before the man was apprehended by an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer: he lets <hi>Gaunt,</hi> who plainly appears to be as arrant a Traytor as could he in the World, to go away meerly upon his own Parole, without taking any courſe to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him. He pretends he is a poor man, and he might have gain'd 100 <hi>l.</hi> if he had diſcover'd him, and ſurely he would have diſcover'd him, to gain 100 <hi>l.</hi> but this is a ſtrong Argument, that he was deep in the Rebellion himſelf, and one in great eſteem with them, that being a poor man, he would not do his Duty, for which he might have had a reward of 100 <hi>l.</hi> but ſuffers him to eſcape. This is the Caſe, Gentlemen, that is before you, if you believe he did knowingly, as he himſelf upon the matter doth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:204358:12"/> confeſs, give any comfort or relief to <hi>Burton,</hi> knowing him to be a Rebel, you ought to find him guilty.</p>

So he ask'd the man of the houſe to ſhew a Room: He ſhew'd a Box, but he would have a Room, and went up ſtairs, and call'd for Pipes and a Candle, and a pint of Wine. In a little while <hi>Keeling</hi> came in, and brought <hi>Barber</hi> and <hi>Thompſon,</hi> and no body ſpake almoſt any thing but <hi>Rumbold,</hi> (that was <hi>Rumbold</hi> with one eye, for <hi>Keeling</hi> when he came in call'd him Capt. <hi>Rumbold</hi>) and <hi>Rumbold</hi> talk'd about Priviledges and ſuch things at firſt and he ſaid his houſe was a convenient houſe, and there they might do the buſineſs: but before they had done, I found they deſign'd to kill the King, but nothing troubled him but killing the Poſtillion, <hi>to kill a man in cold blood.</hi> But then ſays we, <hi>If you are for killing, we have done,</hi> and ſo broke up; that was the end of that. A while after Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> went in, and made a Diſcovery: I never came among them afterwards So, after Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> had diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I was in the Proclamation for being there at that meeting, and abſconded my ſelf, and lay hid. A matter of two months after, Mrs. <hi>Gaunt</hi> came to enquire of my Wife where I was, to ſpeak with me; ſhe brought her to me. She told me there were ſome perſons about to make an eſcape, and would have me go along with them. I told her, with all my heart? So I ask'd her which way and how they intended to go: She told me they had provided Horſes to ride down to <hi>Rochford</hi>-Hundred, and there was a Veſſel to carry them over; and, ſays ſhe, <hi>be ready by ſuch an evening, and I will call for you.</hi> Accordingly ſhe did, &amp; had me into <hi>Biſhopſgate-ſtreet,</hi> and in <hi>Half-moon-Alley</hi> in a little Brew houſe up ſtairs in a Chamber there were both the <hi>Rumbolds,</hi> one of them did not go, and the other and I lay there all night, and in the morning a man came and called us away, and we went to <hi>White-Chappel</hi> to take Horſe, to ride down
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:204358:14"/> to <hi>Rochford</hi>-Hundred, and ſtaid for the Veſſel two days; and when we met the Veſſel, it was a ſmall Veſſel, and bad weather, and the Maſter of the Veſſel had but one hand, and two Boys, one a very little one; and we went down the Creek, and I asked the man where he did intend to land us; and he told us at <hi>Oſtend.</hi> Said I, I underſtood we were to go for <hi>Holland</hi> to the <hi>Brill.</hi> Says he, My Veſſel is only able to go to <hi>Oſtend</hi> or <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> either of them. Says <hi>Rumbold,</hi> I don't underſtand the Sea. Says I, This is a very ſmall Veſſel, and leaky, and the man not able to manage it. Says I, I will go back again to <hi>London.</hi> Says he, I will do as you do; and we both parted at <hi>London,</hi> and I never ſaw him afterwards till I ſaw him at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> I lay by a great many months after; then Mrs. <hi>Gaunt</hi> came to me again, and told me there was two other perſons going, and I might have a paſſage if I would go: So ſhe bid me be ready by ſuch an evening, and I was ready, and a Boat being ready at the water-ſide, carried me to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> where I went in a Veſſel to <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, this Woman ſtands Indicted for High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for concealing, comforting and relieving one <hi>James Burton,</hi> a perſon that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted High Treaſon; and for endeavouring that he might make his eſcape, and giving him 5 l. in money. Gentlemen, the evidence that is given is by <hi>Burton,</hi> his Wife and his Daughter. <hi>Burton</hi> ſaies that this Woman was very ſolicitous ſeveral times to help to ſend him beyond Sea. He does tell you, that when there was a Plot againſt the life of the King, wherein <hi>Rumbold</hi> was concerned, and one of the chief Actors, that he himſelf was preſent at one of the Conſultations concerning it, and that afterwards be did withdraw himſelf from the Company, as he ſaies; but he ſaies, that this Womans Husband being likewiſe concerned in the Plot, and this woman, as he believes, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was able to make ſome Diſcovery concerning her Husband, and knowing alſo his danger in reſpect of his own guilt, ſhe endeavours to ſend him away firſt to <hi>Rochford,</hi> and ſo to go beyond Sea. And afterwards in another place in <hi>Houndſditch,</hi> and from thence he was to be conveyed beyond Sea. It is true, there is no direct proof that there was any particular mention that <hi>Burton</hi> was in the Proclamation for that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but the woman ſaies, and <hi>Burton</hi> himſelf ſaies, that they do both verily believe that the Priſoner at the Bar, did know he was in the Proclamation, and therefore there was no particular diſcourſe concerning it; and ſhe her ſelf being examined, ſaies, ſhe might hear that his name was in the Proclamation, and ſhe might hear that his houſe was ſearched, and that he could not be found; and yet notwithſtanding all this, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to conceal him. What can be the meaning of all this, in this woman, but that ſhe was very zealous to maintain the Conſpiracy, and was a great Aſſiſtant to all perſons that were concerned in it. She will not tell you any other cauſe wherefore ſhe ſhould be concerned to convey this man beyond Sea, and therefore in all reaſon you ought to conceive it was for this; it was a known cauſe, made known to all people by the Kings Proclamation. If you believe ſhe did know or believe <hi>Burton</hi> to have been
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:204358:16"/> guilty of that Treaſon, and that ſhe did help to convey him away, as the Witneſſes have proved that ſhe did, by giving him money, and ſoliciting him ſeveral times to be then you ought to find her guilty.</p>

Another Inſtance of Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi>'s Rebellion, for I need not tell you what part he acted when he was Sheriff, and maintained that; that was the ground work of the Rebellion, ſetting the Commonalty againſt the Government of the City. Another Inſtance we will give you is, his Under-Sheriff that was employed to divide the City, and to raiſe men within the City, having diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> about ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling that matter, he liked it very well, and promiſed he would be aſſiſting to him, and you may eaſily preſume Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> the Under-Sheriff was very privy to all the acts of Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> at that time.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Rumſey,</hi> pray will you give my Lord and the Jury an Account of the Inſurrection that was to have been in <hi>England,</hi> in the late King's time, and what concern the Priſoner had in that affair.</p>

               <p>My Lord, about the later end of <hi>October,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> deſired me to go to Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi>'s houſe, where there was a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Gentlemen that I did name before, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sheppard,</hi> and accordingly I went; I came late there my ſelf, for they were juſt going away, when I came in; I told them my meſſage, and they told me they were diſappointed by Mr. <hi>Trenchard.</hi> I had not been there a quarter of an hour, but we were going away, and Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> was call'd for by his man, and he went down ſtairs and brought up Mr. <hi>Corniſh;</hi> and when he came into the Room, he told the Gentlemen there met, that Mr. Alderman <hi>Corniſh</hi> was come; ſo as ſoon as Mr. Alderman <hi>Corniſh</hi> came into the Room, he made his excuſe to the Gentlemen that he did not come ſooner, and that he could not ſtay with them; the reaſon why he could not ſtay with them, he told them, was, that they were to meet that night about their Charter, and there was never ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Alderman in Town but himſelf, and therefore he could not ſtay, there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of an Alderman to be there. And upon that Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> opened his boſom, and from under his Stomacher pull'd out a Paper; they told him, they had that Paper read, and deſired to read it to him: Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> read it, and Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> held the Candle all the while that it was reading; and after they had read it, they asked him how he liked it, and he did ſay he liked it very well.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Rumſey,</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>The firſt part of it was complaining of the miſgovernment of the late King; there were two Points in it that I do remember very well, that they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for: One was, <hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> and t'other was, That all thoſe that would aſſiſt in that Inſurrection, that had any Lands of the Church, or the Kings, in the late War, ſhould have them reſtored to them.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Rumſey,</speaker>
               <p>I did not hear all the Paper, nor did I take great notice of it; but thoſe two Points were in it, to engage them that would aſſiſt.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Rumſey,</speaker>
               <p>It was to be a Declaration upon the Riſing, when the Riſing was to have been; this was to have been diſperſed abroad.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Rumſey,</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and they met there for that purpoſe; and Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> was the man to manage the buſineſs about <hi>Taunton,</hi> and he diſappointed them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Rumſey,</speaker>
               <p>It was to know what iſſue they had come to about the Riſing, and to preſs them to it, for ſuch a matter as that was not to be long kept afoot; either let them come to a reſolution to Riſe, or let it fall for good and all.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Rumſey,</speaker>

               <speaker>Mr. Rumſey,</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> did ſay, he did like the Declaration, and with the ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt he had, he would appear to back it, or words to that effect.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of that buſineſs of my Lord <hi>Ruſſels;</hi> but there was a deſign to Riſe, Sir, in <hi>London;</hi> we deſign'd to divide it into twenty parts, and out of each part to raiſe five hundred men, if it might be done, to make an Inſurrection.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Goodenough,</speaker>
               <p>They were to take the <hi>Tower,</hi> and drive the Guards out of Town.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Goodenough,</speaker>
               <p>Before this was agreed on by us, I chanced to be at Alderman <hi>Corniſh</hi>'s; Sir, ſaid I, now the Law won't defend us, tho' we be never ſo innocent; but ſome other way is to be thought on; upon this, ſaid he, I wonder the City is ſo unready, and the Country ſo ready. I ſaid to him again, Sir, there is ſomething thought of to be done here; but, ſaies I, in the firſt place, the Tower ought to be ſeized, where the Magazine is; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this he made a little pauſe, and ſaid, I will do what I can, or what good I can, to this purpoſe he anſwered me; and about ſome time after, he met me upon the Exchange, and asked me, how affairs went? which I underſtood to be relating to what we diſcours'd; this is all that I can ſay. I never met after this, but only upon the Exchange, he asked how matters went.</p>

               <p>Was there any diſcourſe about ſeizing the Guards?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Goodenough,</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Goodenough,</speaker>
               <p>I told him, ſaies I, Sir, now it is plain, the Law will not defend us, tho' we are never ſo innocent, or to this purpoſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>

               <p>How?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Goodenough,</speaker>
               <p>This was in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term, as near as I can remember 83.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, 83.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Goodenough,</speaker>
               <p>Therefore, ſaies I, ſomething elſe is to be thought on, ſome courſe elſe is to be taken: to this purpoſe he anſwered me, I wonder the City is ſo unready, and the Country ſo ready.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Goodenough,</speaker>
               <p>He had been in the Country, as I underſtood, before, that I don't know.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Corniſh,</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Goodenough,</speaker>
               <p>In <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term, or thereabout, 83. I told him then, Sir, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thought of to be done here in <hi>London,</hi> to this purpoſe; but, ſaies I, in the firſt place, the <hi>Tower</hi> is to be ſeized, where the Magazin is; ſo he anſwered me, after ſome pauſe (he pauſed upon it) ſaies he, I will do what good I can, or what I can, to this purpoſe.</p>

               <p>Not at all, Sir, it did not appear ſo to me.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I never had any diſcourſe of this matter, or any thing relating to it at any other time, but only when I came upon the Exchange, how things went.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Sol. Gen.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>And did you give him an account?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I ſaid, well, I gave him a general anſwer, for that was not a place to talk in, and that I apprehended of this diſcourſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Sol. Gen.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, Colonel <hi>Rumſey</hi> is a perſon that hath acquainted the Court, that there was a long acquaintance between him and me.

My Lord, it is a very improbable thing, that I ſhould meet him at Mr. <hi>Sheppards,</hi> where I ſaw ſuch wicked and horrible doings; and that he ſhould never afterwards ſpeak to me about that affair; he came to my houſe, I remember, about the return of ſome Moneys for his own private uſe; for he was then out of His Majeſties Employment.

Then comes <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and he tells you, That he came to him in his Parlour, when he was Sherriff, ſaid, Now there was no ſafety, no defence at all by Law, all was gone, there muſt be ſome other courſe taken, for the Law would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently protect them; Why? ſays Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> I marvel they are ſo ſlow in the City, when they are ſo ready in the Country; Ay, but ſays <hi>Goodenough</hi> again to him, there hath been ſomething done in the City; this was after the time that the City had been put into ſeveral Diviſions. I don't ſee there is any Teſtimony from Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> knew any thing of that, but ſays he, There is ſomething done here, the Tower is to be ſeiz'd, there is the Magazine, and that is to be ſeized upon, and then we ſhall be able to do ſomething, ſays he, I will do what good I can, or, ſays he, what I can, he is not confident whether of theſe Expreſſions he did uſe, I will do what good I can, or I will do what I can. Afterwards he meets Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, here, I confeſs, it is not ſo expreſly to be applied to this purpoſe, that it doth faſten directly upon the point in the Indictment, but ſays he, How do Affairs go? How do our Affairs go? ſays he, very well: This is the Teſtimony given againſt him. If this be true, notwithſtanding Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi>'s proteſtations of his Innocency, ſure there is nothing doth more plainly prove this Indictment, than this Teſtimony. He ſays it is Improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, very improbable that I in my circumſtances, that I ſhould ſay ſo, it is improbable, becauſe Mr. <hi>Rumſey</hi> had Acquaintance with me for fourteen years together, that I have dealt with him for vaſt Sums, and that I ſhould ſay it in his preſence never but once, and that <hi>Rumſey</hi> does ſay, He never heard him ſpeak any thing to that purpoſe, but that one time, and therefore it is mighty improbable I ſhould ſay ſo. But what is the reaſon, ſays he, that this was not diſcover'd before? To this <hi>Rumſey</hi> gives a very poſitive anſwer, Truly, ſays he, Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> I had more Compaſſion for you, than for my ſelf, I have ſuffer'd for it, you have not ſuffer'd for my ſilence. Then <hi>Goodenough</hi> ought not to be allowed to be a competent Witneſs, becauſe when Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> were choſen Sheriffs of the City, Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> was much againſt receiving <hi>Goodenough</hi> to be his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:204358:21"/> and <hi>Goodenough</hi> muſt ſay all this maliciouſly againſt him, becauſe he ſo much oppoſed his being Under-Sherriff to him and <hi>Bethel,</hi> he hath produced ſeveral Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to that purpoſe, and they ſay there was ſome reluctancy in him to the receiving <hi>Goodenough</hi> to be his Under Sherriff, but it is plain and clear to you all, Gentlemen, and every body in the City knows that <hi>Goodenough</hi> was his Under-Sherriff, and how well he ſerved him, and to what purpoſes I believe many of you very well know. Another improbability is, That he ſhould admit <hi>Goodenough</hi> to come into his Parlour alone, a Man that he had ſo much diſpleaſed, but if ſo be he was once againſt him, he did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards take him not only to be his Under-Sheriff, but employ'd him to be his Attorney, and then he might very well admit him into his Parlour alone, to diſcourſe of his buſineſs, as an Attorney, and this might fall in among other diſcourſe: Gentlemen, there are ſeveral other Witneſſes produced concerning the honeſty of his Dealing, and the honeſty of his Converſation, that they have nothing at all to ſay againſt; but Gentlemen, in a popular City, where he is, and hath been ſo well known, it is a very eaſie matter to bring millions of Men to give the very ſame Teſtimony, and certainly he will bring none, having the choice of them, but ſuch as ſhall ſpeak in his favour; but he ſpeaks in the preſence of God, he ſpeaks from the bottom of his Heart, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any ſuch diſloyal Thought entred into his mind: Gentlemen, Hath no body any ſenſe of the preſence of God but Mr. <hi>Corniſh?</hi> Hath not <hi>Rumſey</hi> call'd God to be a Witneſs to his Oath? and <hi>Goodenough</hi> hath done the like? Why is it maliciouſly againſt the Life of Mr. <hi>Corniſh?</hi> for I don't know he does, in the leaſt, object any thing againſt <hi>Rumſey,</hi> that there was ever any diſpleaſure between them two, Why ſhould he deliver this Teſtimony if it were not the Teſtimony of his heart? and that which he ſays himſelf, he had too long concealed out of the compaſsion he had for him. Gentlemen, if a great many Proteſtations and Aſſeverations ſhould make a man as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent as confident, no man ſhould die by the Sentence of the Law; it is an eaſie matter for any man to take up the ſame aſſurance and confidence that he hath done: And for his being ſuch a Church-man, as he now pretends himſelf to be, for that is one thing by which he would argue the improbability of the thing, and he would have you believe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much of his Loyalty from it. Gentlemen, all the Evidence he hath given, is but of two years ſtanding, and ſince the Tryal of my Lord <hi>Ruſſel;</hi> and ſuch a man as he, and many men that were conſcious to themſelves of their Guilt, did think it very fit to purge themſelves that way, to gain themſelves a good opinion that they were Loyal to the Government: But it is not deny'd by Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> that before that time he did not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Church, nor receive the Sacrament.</p>

               <p>Truly I can't ſay whether it was that night when the Paper was read, but I do poſitively ſay, that there was no Paper read, for he was not looked upon to be of the Company: Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> told me poſitively, there is the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> Coll. <hi>Rumſey,</hi> my ſelf and you.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> did go up into the Room, and ſpake with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> or ſome other Perſon, but I think the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, when I came to Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi>'s Houſe, Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> came down and fetch'd me up, and I deliver'd my meſſage I had to the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and to the Company, and indeed I was not a quarter of an hour there, I believe, but by that time I had ſpoke my words, ſome body knock'd at the door, and Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> went down, and immediately brought up Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> into the room, without asking a queſtion of any body; and when he was come into the room, Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> ſaid, he could not come ſooner, becauſe he had buſineſs, and could not ſtay, becauſe there was a Committee, for the management of the Charter, to meet that night, and there was a neceſſity of his being there, becauſe there was never another Alderman in Town, and there muſt be an Alderman there.</p>

               <p>There was a Cabal of Rebels met together, and you go and bring up this man to them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any leave or licence from them, which is incredible, certainly, unleſs you knew him to be one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and equally engaged with them.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen, there hath been a very great indulgence given to the Priſoner, and it is to ſhew you what tenderneſs a Court of Juſtice hath, and always will have, of the lives of the King's Subjects: After a ful Evidence, though he had neglected his Defence, yet you were again ſent for into Court, to hear what further Evidenee he had to offer to you; I cannot but obſerve, this looks like a ſubtile Contrivance on the Priſoners part; you ſee what endeavors have been made by Mr. Attorney General, to have had him here a Witneſs for the King, you have obſerved he hath told you he had a Subpoena left for him, but he was abſent, in what Company he was abſent yeſterday, he hath told you, With Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi>'s Son; this morning he was not to be found, after he had received this Subpoena, and a Subpoena from Mr. <hi>Corniſh;</hi> he ſtays without, and gives no notice, but when you are withdrawn, can ſend intelligence to Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> that he hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay, that, he hopes, will excuſe him; now what that is, I muſt beg you a little to obſerve: Truly I am very glad for the ſatisfaction of all men, that Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> hath now been here, and he is ſo far from invalidating any one part of the Teſtimony, that by all the circumſtances you can collect from this Evidence that is given, it is a corroboration of it: Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> was accuſed of being preſent at Conſultations that have been held againſt the Life of the King, and for raiſing Rebellion at Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi>'s Houſe; his excuſing his not coming there is a ſufficient Argument to prove he was privy to their Meeting, he hath gone on further, &amp; proved to you the reading the Declaration; now what ſays <hi>Sheppard</hi> to this Witneſs? Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> by the way, I muſt obſerve to you, before, did deny his being there; he had been ſometimes in Company with <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> but he did not like the man, he ſays, becauſe of his Morals; now the Witneſs he hath produced hath given you this Teſtimony, that Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> hath been there in that Company, that he came in ſuch a manner, that no man but muſt be ſatisfied he was privy to their Deſigns, and did know of their Meeting, for he comes when the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the reſt of the Conſpirators, were there met in private, with a direct charge to Mr. <hi>Sheppard,</hi> that is the Witneſs, that they ſhould be ſo private, that no one Servant ſhould come up into the Room, yet Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> tells you, that when Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> came he carried him up into the Room, without ſo much as acquainting any one of the Company that Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> had a deſire to come, but brings him up as if he were (and I make no doubt but you will imagine, he was) one of the Company; when he comes there, he ſays his buſineſs is with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Head of that Conſpiracy, and he himſelf tells you he never had any dealings with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> in his life; What can a man imagine of that man that had
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:204358:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> no dealing with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> to find him out in a place, where no mortal could know, and none was to know, and coming to him at that time and at that place, under thoſe circumſtances of concealment, no man almoſt but out of his own mouth muſt believe that he was privy to that Conſpiracy, therefore though this Witneſs doth ſeem to forget ſome part of the Evidence, the reading the Declaration, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Candle; yet theſe are ſuch circumſtances that in themſelves do carry a proof of the Charge, and do confirm all the reſt that the Witneſs hath ſaid, and this muſt be a great ſatisfaction to you, that he was there preſent and privy to that Deſign. And ſo I leave it to your Conſideration.</p>

               <p>You, the ſeveral Priſoners at the Bar, you have been ſeverally indicted here of the High Crime of Treaſon; for you, Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> I apply my ſelf firſt to you, your crime is for Treaſon that was committed in his late Majeſties life time, being one of thoſe notorious Conſpirators that deſigned to raiſe Rebellion, and others ſome of them immediately deſigned the life of his Majeſty that then was, and his preſent Majeſty, that was the deſign of ſome of them; and others, they had another part, that was, to raiſe Rebellion, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſome of them in and about this City, and it was carried on ſome time before it was diſcovered, may be a year or more, under colour and pretence of Law: For ſo did they invade the Government, firſt of all by pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Juries, there was the foundation laid whereby to bring on that buſineſs, which they had at laſt deſigned, when they could bring it to a ripe Head. Too many Perſons in that buſineſs, I believe, were very buſie, medling with that that they had not to do with, Clubbing and Caballing how to bring their Deſigns about, in oppoſition to the Government, not to ſupport it in the leaſt, but to overthrow it if it were poſſible: But then, at laſt, then they muſt take another courſe, for no longer could they carry it on by pretence of Law, as you, have heard to day: Now we muſt take other meaſures, and take down-right blows. This is the buſineſs, Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> that you have been indicted for; and, I muſt tell you, whatever apprehenſions you have to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and may pleaſe your ſelf in, I am ſorry to ſee ſuch a ſort of pleaſure in your Countenance, as if you had had no favour ſhewed you. I believe the Court hath ſhewed you more favour, and had more patience with you than ever any man that ſtood in your place had; for calling a Witneſs after the Jury hath been out, is a thing I never ſaw a Precedent for: And I am glad it was done, for I think it hath clear'd the thing beyond all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of contradiction, before it looked ſomething dark for want of <hi>Sheppard,</hi> and ſo it is a happineſs that that man was called, to convince you of many things that you proteſted ſo ſolemnly againſt, which I am ſorry to ſee in you in this condition that you are, to make ſuch ſolemn Proteſtations, and afterwards to call a Witneſs to confront you in them. For the other two, here is Mr. <hi>Ring</hi> is very notorious for harbouring a couple of Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, knowing from whence they came; and if it were not for ſuch Perſons as theſe are, that do harbour them when they fly, it may be there would not be ſo many bold Attempts to commit ſuch Crimes as theſe are: To provide for them, and nouriſh them, and comfort them, after they have committed their Villanies, this does encourage them to commit their Villanies as they do, and ſo I reckon harbourers to be worſe than Traytors themſelves, they are like Receivers to Thieves; there would not be ſo many Traytors, if there were no Harbourers: You have been Convicted of theſe great Crimes, it is too late, and not fitting to ſpend time any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but to Pronounce the ſeveral Sentences againſt you, which is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You muſt, every one of you, be had back to the place from whence you came, from thence you muſt be drawn to the place of Execution, and there you muſt ſeverally be hanged by the necks, every one of you by the neck 'till you are almoſt dead, and then you must be cut down, your Intrails muſt be taken out and burnt before your faces, your ſeveral Heads be cut off, and your bodies divided into four parts, and thoſe to be diſpoſed of at the pleaſure of the King; and the Lord have mercy upon your Souls.</hi>
